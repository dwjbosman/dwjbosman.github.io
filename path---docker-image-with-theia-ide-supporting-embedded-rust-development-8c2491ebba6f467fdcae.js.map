Rust is interesting because it can produce high performance efficient software, it has constructs for 'safe' memory management and could be a competitor to C. Getting Rust running is not that hard. Getting Rust running with bare metal ARM support for embedded development is a little bit more work. What about an IDE? \\n<p>Certainly when starting out with a new programming language you want to have modern editor support.

Essential for a replacement is that it would have a great editor as a front end running locally but would also have a back end supporting specific tools/programming languages running remotely. </p>\\n<p>Some editors have support for remote editing (for example via sshfs) but they still require all dependent libraries to be installed locally in order to do semantic checking or code completion. A few exciting open source applications have started to address this. Especially Eclipse Che and Theia caught my attention. Theia is a VS Code clone that runs in the browser. Therefore its back end naturally runs remotely. It uses the <a href=\\\"https://langserver.org/\\\">Remote Language Server (LSP)</a> API designed by Microsoft. The editor front end can support multiple programming languages as long as an LSP implementation is available.
