A few exciting open source applications have started to address this. Especially Eclipse Che and Theia caught my attention. Theia is a VS Code clone that runs in the browser. Therefore its back end naturally runs remotely. It uses the <a href=\\\"https://langserver.org/\\\">Remote Language Server (LSP)</a> API designed by Microsoft.
