Although not for beginners I can recommend this book to anyone with some knowledge of FPGA's and general programming skills. To get some practical experience I obtained two dev kits:  </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A <a href=\\\"https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/zedboard:zedboard_ug.pdf\\\">Zedboard</a> dev kit containing an Xilinx Zync </li>\\n<li>A <a href=\\\"https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/nexys4-ddr:nexys4ddr_rm.pdf\\\">Nexys4-DDR</a> with Xylinx Artix-7 from Digilent </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Digilent also sells PMOD modules which are extension modules containing specialized IO chips. I bought the <a href=\\\"https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodi2s2/reference-manual\\\">I2S2 DA/AD board</a> with I2S interface. It can sample as well as playback audio wave data via a simple I2S protocol. It is based on the <a href=\\\"https://www.cirrus.com/products/cs4344-45-48/\\\">CS4344</a> and CS5343 chips from Cypress. In this article I focus on the CS4344 DA converter.</p>\\n<p>Using the I2S board is relatively simple when compared with for example the audio chip embedded on the Zedboard. That chip supports a complex signal path with many registers. Setting one of the registers to a wrong value will quickly result in no audio output. Debugging would to take a lot of effort for a first project. The CS4344 however is very simple. It has an I2S interface and no registers to set. Even its datasheet is short :) I can simulate the VHDL on fore hand before flashing and check the output I2S waveform. If that is correct the audio chip will produce sound.</p>\\n<p>The roadmap of my project is as follows:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>First produce a square wave with a specific frequency.</li>\\n<li>Produce a single sine wave with a specific frequency.</li>\\n<li>Implement I2S AD reception and loopback to the DA output.</li>\\n<li>Implement an additive synthesis engine based on a bandwidth enhanced sine model.

Then the input scaled frequency would be:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>frequency_scaled = frequency * power2_phase_step\\nfrequency_scaled -> 56321</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>If it would be possible to use floating point arithmetic then the phase step would be:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>phase_step_fp  = ( power2_phase_space_size / sample_rate ) * frequency</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>or rewritten:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>phase_step_fp -> ( power2_phase_space_size * frequency ) / sample_rate\\nphase_step_fp -> 76896.93867</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The integer version of phase_step_fp consists of two parts: phase_step_decimal and phase_step_numerator. Phase_step_decimal will give the decimal part (in the example 76895) while the fraction (0.57333...). The decimal part is calculated as follows:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>scaled_phase  = frequency_scaled * scaled_phase_step\\nscaled_phase -> 161264538831\\n\\ndecimal_divider_bits  = power2_phase_step_bits + phase_step_scaling_bits\\ndecimal_divider_bits -> 21\\nphase_step_decimal    = shift_right ( scaled_phase, decimal_deivider_bits)\\nphase_step_decimal   -> 76896</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Generally the phase_step_decimal will equal the decimal part of the phase_step_fp. In corner cases when the fractional part of phase_step_fp is near zero the decimal part will be off by one. For example with a scaled frequency of 440573 (3441.97 Hz) the actual phase step will be 601529.0027. However the quantised phase step will be floor(601528.8912) = 601528 which is off by one. </p>\\n<p>Now the fractional part is calculated as a rational value. The value consists of a numerator and divisor.  Recall the calculation of phase_step_fp:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>phase_step_fp -> ( power2_phase_space_size * frequency ) / sample_rate</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This value can be converted to a rational number:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>phase_step_divisor  = sample_rate\\nphase_step_divisor -> 48000\\n\\nusing frequency_scaled (an integer value) instead of the floating point frequency:\\n\\nphase_step_numerator_incl_decimal  = ( power2_phase_space_size * frequency_scaled ) / power2_phase_step\\nphase_step_numerator_incl_decimal  = shift_right ( power2_phase_space_size * frequency_scaled, power2_phase_step_bits)\\nphase_step_numerator_incl_decimal -> 3691053056</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The fact that phase_step_fp is larger than one implies that the numerator is larger than the divisor. To get the fractional part without the decimal part the decimal value is subtracted:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>phase_step_numerator  = phase_step_numerator_incl_decimal - phase_step_decimal * sample_rate\\nphase_step_numerator -> 45056</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Assert that the rational number is indeed the fractional part of phase_step_fp:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>phase_step_fp -> 76896.93867\\nphase_step_numerator / phase_step_divisor -> 0.93867</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In the earlier described corner cases it could be that the numerator is still larger than the divider after subtraction of the decimal part. It will however always be smaller than 2 * divider. So when the numerator is larger than the divider it is possible to simply subtract the divider once to get the numerator corresponding to the fractional part. In that case the phase_step_decimal value is increased by one.</p>\\n<p>The sine <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zl4uNqo22D30khxiX1On5RydeTHjTQGgfvHI6CXL8H8/edit?usp=sharing\\\">phase step</a>  calculations in this section can also be found on Google sheets.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"vhdl-design\\\"><a href=\\\"#vhdl-design\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>VHDL Design</h1>\\n<p>In this article I focus on generating a single sine wave.

The check indeed shows that the sine wave has a frequency of 440 Hz.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/sine_440-273ac55780a91441eb21b34e03f5cd5d-1c0e9.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1079px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 31.60333642261353%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAIAAABM9SnKAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABEUlEQVQY01WLy06DUBCGh5yDwOHSoEDrxrIxfRyNFomlXiK1VNNGEpO6QNs3NQYFCgW0MXEthzaNTiZf/vlmBl7DNIyyMFpGi/ztI4vT8j3Jq5wsv5K0jBdFnBRJ9lmufuK0qLZZvsrL73XDg/84nT4Fzy+2bR8dn1iWddrtBoEzm194Xu/sf9nnPWcy709m6xGcy+vqvX/lqkOVd/nGfUMYCPs+ZZXFoajcKfJIljyJjp6m+3pl1DE9hoO22TnsmG2THbCMy8ANVCQj2Oa/FMZ76BZtDbDsjmEYmqbxKo9kBDIgFZEmJUhADakp1maXUCobDxzHtZotQzdkmccCBgYwxoRQAgJq2Jq4NiyhhI3/BUcRZQVHd0cfAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"440 Hz sine wave\\\"\\n        title=\\\"440 Hz sine wave\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/sine_440-273ac55780a91441eb21b34e03f5cd5d-1c0e9.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/sine_440-273ac55780a91441eb21b34e03f5cd5d-a0af6.png 300w,\\n/static/sine_440-273ac55780a91441eb21b34e03f5cd5d-b3d4a.png 600w,\\n/static/sine_440-273ac55780a91441eb21b34e03f5cd5d-1c0e9.png 1079w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"final-thoughts\\\"><a href=\\\"#final-thoughts\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Final thoughts</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>It would be interesting to check if the fixed point value types in VHDL 2008 could simplify things.

The advantage of using a bare metal approach is that software runs without any (undeterministic) operating system overhead. An obvious disadvantage is that you need to implement basic Operating System tasks (eg. file system access, memory management) yourself. </p>\\n<p>In the earlier proposed synthesizer, I would like to develop the audio engine will run in real time. This engine will run partly on a Microblaze and will be implemented partly in custom FPGA logic. Besides audio processing the software will also need to implement systems management functions. Systems management will enable functions such as servicing an embedded website, providing firmware updates and voice patch editing. These functions can be implemented in a non Real Time environment. Furthermore the MIDI protocol can also be handled by a non Real Time environment as long as the latency is not too large. </p>\\n<p>The described management functions can be implemented with ease on a Linux platform. In this article I will show how to get Linux up and running on a Xilinx Zynq Zed board. There are a number of tutorials around which describe Linux on the Zed board. This tutorial adds the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use Yocto Linux</li>\\n<li>Use a device tree (dts/dtb) based upon the custom functionality implemented in the FPGA. This allows the Linux implementation to access the custom FPGA functions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In this tutorial the programmable logic (PL) will be configured to contain a GPIO block connected via AXI to the ARM chips in the Zynq programmable system (PS). Linux will run on the PS and will be able to access the GPIO block in the PL.</p>\\n<p>The Yocto files and VHDL code can be found in the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dwjbosman/yocto_zedboard.git\\\">yocto_zedboard</a> repository.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/linux_board-d77103bed1247944b113e05cf7c7053e.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Yocto GPIO ZED board\\\" title=\\\"Yocto on ZED board\\\"></p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"design\\\"><a href=\\\"#design\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Design</h1>\\n<p>In order to get Linux running on the Zed Board, I will be using the SD Card. On the SD card there are two partitions: boot and root. For the root filesystem I will be using Ubuntu. The boot partition needs the following files:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>boot.bin : FSBL bootloader. This bootloader reads the FPGA bit file from the SD card boot partition (fpga.bin) and starts u-boot.</li>\\n<li>fpga.bin : FPGA logic fabric bitfile converted to bin format.</li>\\n<li>u-boot.img : u-boot Linux bootloader.</li>\\n<li>uEnv.txt : u-boot boot configuration.</li>\\n<li>uImage-system-top.dtb : Linux device tree,.</li>\\n<li>uImage : Yocto Linux Kernel.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Yocto can provide these files based on input coming from Xilinx Vivado and the Xilinx SDK. In Vivado the functions defined in the Zynq PL are exported via a device tree (dts file). This device tree is then compiled into a device tree blob (dtb file) when Yocto builds the Linux image. The Linux kernel can then provide an interface to the custom FPGA logic. In more details the steps are as follows:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Define the block design in Vivado.\\n1.1. Export the bit file to the Xilinx SDK</li>\\n<li>Use the SDK to export a device tree source file (dts)  </li>\\n<li>Convert the fpga bit file to a bin file (fpga.bin)</li>\\n<li>Configure yocto to build a Linux kernel and boot files.\\n4.1. Use Docker to run Yocto\\n4.2. Add the meta-Xilinx layer to add support for the Zynq processor\\n4.3. Add a custom layer which provides the custom device tree (dts) files</li>\\n<li>Configure the root file system, using Ubuntu</li>\\n<li>Formatting the SD card and store the required boot files</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In the following sections the steps are described in more detail: </p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"1-xilinx-zynq-block-design\\\"><a href=\\\"#1-xilinx-zynq-block-design\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>1. Xilinx Zynq Block Design</h1>\\n<p>The proof of concept consists of a GPIO block connected to the Zed board LEDs and switches. The GPIO block is connected to the PS via the AXI bus. One of the LEDs is connected to a counter which causes it to blink. The blinking LED was added so that you can see that the FPGA logic was programmed during booting. The Zynq PS needs the following features: DDR memory, UART (Linux terminal), SPI (SD card) and  Ethernet. </p>\\n<p>The block design can be found in the github project. Start Vivado (I use version 2018.2), select the tools menu and execute the tcl script inside the vivado_linux_zynq/ folder. This will create the project.

Yocto Linux image</h1>\\n<p>Yocto is a framework of tools to create custom embedded Linux distributions. Yocto consists of the embedded Linux distribution Poky and the OpenEmbedded (OE) build system. Yocto consists of layers. Each layer can add new features or modify existing features. A custom layer will be added to inject the dts files from the previous step.</p>\\n<p>In order to build a Linux image with Yocto a number of prerequisite tools need to be installed. In order to keep my PC clean, Docker is used to be able to install all dependencies without affecting my normal day-to-day work. The Docker file can be found in the repository.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Clone the repository</li>\\n<li>Copy the required dts and dtsi to the <pre>meta-dts/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-xlnx/zedboard-zynq7/</pre> folder.</li>\\n<li>If needed update the <pre>meta-dts/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-xlnx_%.bbappend</pre> file to include the copied dts/dtsi files.</li>\\n<li>cd in to the 'yocto' sub directory.</li>\\n<li>Create the Docker image by running \\\"make image\\\". After this step is completed (which will take quite a long time!) the Docker image will contain the Linux image files for the Zed Board</li>\\n<li>Run the \\\"run.sh\\\" script to create and log in to a Docker container.

Booting</h1>\\n<p>After copying the files to the SD card, unmount the paritions. Plug the SD card in the ZED board, connect the UART and power up the board. Use a terminal program (eg.

Press the PS-RST button to restart the ZED board; this will keep the serial connection active.

The synthesizer needs a processor to implement high level functionality. In this article a small step is taken by making it possible to run C/C++ code on a Microblaze processor. The idea is that once we have a general computing platform we can more easily develop high level C programs that interface with custom hardware peripherals, such as the I2S transmitter and <a href=\\\"https://dwjbosman.github.io/vhdl-sine-wave-oscillator\\\">sine wave generator</a> described in previous articles.</p>\\n<p>There are quite a number of tutorials about setting up a Microblaze processor. Unfortunately most of these tutorials are either out of date or they are lacking some essential information. This article shows how to get a Microblaze running on a Nexys4 DDR development kit. The designed platform has the following features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Run an user application from the on board DDR2 ram.</li>\\n<li>UART support for debugging</li>\\n<li>Ethernet (lite) support for lwIP stack</li>\\n<li>SPI flash support for bootloading from flash.</li>\\n<li>Use of AXI GPIO for simple LED control</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This tutorial is setup as follows:</p>\\n<h2>Table of contents</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"#1-previous-work\\\">1.

I used this <a href=\\\"https://www.instructables.com/id/Configuring-the-MIG-7-Series-to-Use-the-DDR-Memory/\\\">MIG7</a> tutorial to implement the DDR2 ram.

The TCL project file will contain relative paths which allows your project to be stored in a version control system. </li>\\n<li>Download and install the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/Digilent/vivado-boards.git\\\">Nexys4 DDR board</a> files.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After Vivado starts click the 'create project' button.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"21-screenshots\\\"><a href=\\\"#21-screenshots\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>2.1.

AXI SmartConnect</h2>\\n<p>In a first attempt I added a DDR2 controller. The 'run block automation' reappeared. After running it an \\\"AXI SmartConnect\\\" appeared. I wondered why this was a different component comparing it to the \\\"AXI interconnect\\\" created by the Microblaze Block Automation. The documentation notes that both \\\"Axi SmartConnect\\\"  and \\\"Axi interconnect\\\" have similar functionality and that \\\"Axi SmartConnect\\\" supersedes \\\"Axi interconnect\\\". In all the examples I saw using Microblaze and DDR RAM there were two \\\"Axi interconnect/smartconnect\\\" blocks. In this design I will use one to keep things simple. I'll have to check later how this impacts performance.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Delete the existing \\\"AXI interconnect\\\"</li>\\n<li>Add an \\\"AXI SmartConnect\\\"</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Double click the \\\"AXI SmartConnect\\\" it to customize:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Select the number of slaves: 3 (Microblaze data path, data cache and instruction cache)</li>\\n<li>Select the number of masters: 7 (GPIO, Uartlite, ethernetlite, timer, MIG7, Quad SPI, Interrupt)</li>\\n<li>Select the number of clocks: 2 (the MIG7 will use the second clock input)</li>\\n<li>Enable reset input: has resetn input: 1</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Connect the block:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Connect microblaze M_AXI_DP, M_AXI_DC, M_AXI_IC to the input AXI slave interfaces: S00_AXI, S01_AXI, S02_AXI</li>\\n<li>Connect the \\\"clockin wizard\\\" 100Mhz clock (clk_out1) to the aclk pin.</li>\\n<li>Connect the \\\"processor system reset\\\" output port \\\"interconnect_aresetn\\\" to the resetn input</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The AXI SmartConnect is configures such that all the memory interfacing (including IO mapped peripherals) runs through it.

The un-delayed clock is connected to the MII_to_RMII block. The delayed clock is connected to the LAN8720A. Furthermore there is a discussion if the LAN8720A can be clocked used a synthesized 50MHz clock as there the clock jitter would be outside its datasheet specs.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"381-vivado-screen-shots\\\"><a href=\\\"#381-vivado-screen-shots\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>3.8.1.

AXI DDR2 controller</h2>\\n<p>The Memory Interface Generator (MIG7) is used to create a DDR2 controller for the Micron MT47H64M16HR-25:H RAM chip on the Nexys4 DDR board. The Microblaze will use a BRAM based bootloader to copy the user application from Flash to DDR2 Ram. The DDR2 controller requires precise timing parameters. These are specified in this <a href=\\\"https://www.instructables.com/id/Configuring-the-MIG-7-Series-to-Use-the-DDR-Memory/\\\">DDR2 RAM tutorial</a>. Add a MIG7 component and double click to configure:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>At the introduction page click Next.</li>\\n<li>Again click next.</li>\\n<li>Select the pin compatible FPGA. The Nexys4 DDR uses the xc7a100ti-csg324.</li>\\n<li>Choose DDR2 as controller type.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>On the \\\"Controller options\\\" page select:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Clock period: 3077</li>\\n<li>Memory part: MT47H64M16HR-25E</li>\\n<li>Datawidth: 16 bits</li>\\n<li>Ordering: Normal</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>On the \\\"AXI Parameter\\\" page configure the AXI interface:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Data width: 128</li>\\n<li>Enable narrow burst support (set to one).</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>On the \\\"Memory Options\\\" page choose:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Set the \\\"input clock period\\\" to 100 MHz. If this setting is missing chances are that you run across a bug in the Memory Interface Generator (MIG7). When running Vivado 2018.2 from Ubuntu use the right locale settings. Restart Vivado from the terminal and first execute: export LC_NUMERIC=en_US.utf8</li>\\n<li>Set RTT-ODT to be 50 ohms. </li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>On the \\\"FPGA options\\\" page:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>select \\\"no buffer\\\" for both system clock and reference clock. \\\"no buffer\\\" means that we can connect clocks generated by the clocking wizard.</li>\\n<li>Set the system reset polarity to active low.</li>\\n<li>Enable usage of \\\"Internal vref\\\".</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n<li>On the \\\"Extended FPGA options\\\" choose the Internal termination impedance to be 50 omhs.</li>\\n<li>On the \\\"IO Planning\\\" page select fixed pin out as we want to connect the controller to the external RAM chip.</li>\\n<li>On the \\\"Pin selection\\\" page, type the pin numbers, next click validate. Refer to the XDC constraints below for the actual pin values. The pin selection page does not fit on one page, and you have to scroll to get to all the pins. Be care full when scrolling: scrolling when the mouse is above a pin selection drop down changes the pin!</li>\\n<li>On the \\\"System signals\\\" do not select anything.</li>\\n<li>Verify that the summary report is similar to the screenshot.</li>\\n<li>The last pages \\\"simulation options:\\\": accept, \\\"pcb information\\\": next, \\\"design notes\\\": generate.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The DDR RAM controller will generate its own clock on the \\\"ui_clk\\\" pin. The DDR RAM controller needs its own system reset logic as part of this clock domain. Add another \\\"Processor System Reset\\\", rename it to FPGA_sys_reset\\\".</p>\\n<p>Connect the DDR RAM controller:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Connect the AXI SmartConnect pin \\\"M06\\\\AXI\\\" to the S_AXI pin.</li>\\n<li>Connect the external \\\"reset_n\\\" pin to the \\\"sys_rst\\\" pin of the FPGA_sys_reset block.</li>\\n<li>Connect the clocking wizard \\\"clk_out1\\\" (100 MHz) clock to \\\"sys_clk_i\\\" of the Ram controller.</li>\\n<li>Connect the clocking wizard \\\"clk_out2\\\" (200 MHz) clock to \\\"clk_ref_i\\\" of the RAM controller. </li>\\n<li>Right click the DDR controller \\\"DDR2\\\" pin and make it external. Rename the external pin to \\\"DDR2\\\".</li>\\n<li>Connect the DDR controller \\\"ui_clk_sync_rst\\\" to the \\\"ext_reset_in\\\" of the FPGA_sys_reset block.</li>\\n<li>Connect the DDR controller \\\"ui_clk\\\" clock to the \\\"slowest_sync_clk\\\" of the FPGA_sys_reset block.</li>\\n<li>Connect this clock also to the \\\"aclk1\\\" pin of the AXI SmartConnect.</li>\\n<li>Connect the \\\"mmcm_locked\\\" of the DDR Controller to the  \\\"dcm_locked\\\" pin of the FPGA_sys_reset block.</li>\\n<li>The DDR Controller pin \\\"int_calib_complete\\\" is left unconnected.</li>\\n<li>Connect the FPGA_sys_reset pin \\\"peripheral_aresetn\\\" to the DDR controller \\\"aresetn\\\" pin. </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In some articles it is specified that one should not use a clocking wizard generated clock connected to the DDR controller as it would have too much jitter. In spite of this advice I have used the 200 MHz output of the clock wizard. The following pin constraints are required connecting the DDR RAM chip.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>    set\\\\_property -dict

XDC pin constraints</h1>\\n<p>The XDC file specifies constraints on the physical FPGA pins. Digilent provides a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc/blob/master/Nexys-4-DDR-Master.xdc\\\">XDC file for the Nexys4 DDR</a>. In this tutorial the individual pin constraints are listed with each IP block. Refer to the previous sections. In general a pin constraint is defined as follows:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>    set\\\\_property -dict {PACKAGE\\\\_PIN K17 IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33} [get\\\\_ports OUTPUT\\\\_X]</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>It was not always easy to determine the port name (eg. OUTPUT_X) by examining the block design visually. When the block design is completed and synthesized you can run the \\\"get_ports\\\" command in the TCL window. The names of all the different block design input and output ports will then be displayed.

Configure Bootloader</h3>\\n<p>Open the \\\"Bootloader\\\" project and edit the \\\"blconfig.h\\\" file. The bootloader needs to know the address in SPI flash where the user application resides. Remove the warning and change the \\\"FLASH_IMAGE_BASEADDR\\\" to 0x003D0900. Select the linker \\\"ldscript.ld\\\" file. Set the stack size to 0x200. Check that all segments are assigned to BRAM local memory (and not the external DDR RAM as this memory will receive the user application loaded from the Flash memory). </p>\\n<p>In bootloader.c check that SPI_DEVICE_ID is set to XPAR_SPI_0_DEVICE_ID. The warning line above it can then be removed.</p>\\n<p>In bootloader.c the VERBOSE flag should be defined (by default). This will cause the bootloader to print messages while the bootloading is in progress. The print output will be streamed over the UARTlite interface. The print commands unfortunately slow down the bootloading. A small modification helps. Replace the contents of the function \\\"display_progress\\\" by:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>print(\\\".\\\")</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This will speedup things while still giving some insight in the bootloading progress. After saving Eclipse will rebuild the Bootloader. If all is well the Bootloader should compile without errors now.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-07402.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.927223719676554%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Check bootloader linker map\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Check bootloader linker map\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-bf66f.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-e6e4d.png 300w,\\n/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-04aa4.png 600w,\\n/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-bf66f.png 1200w,\\n/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-7827d.png 1800w,\\n/static/071_Xilinx_SDK_Bootloader_Linker_map-81a90f5bac557e2e25d99d7a0a2ae341-07402.png 1855w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"813-programming-the-fpga\\\"><a href=\\\"#813-programming-the-fpga\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>8.1.3. Programming the FPGA</h3>\\n<p>In step 8.1.4. the hardware design including bootloader will be programmed into flash such that the FPGA loads it every time it boots. Configure the SPI jumper on the Nexys4 DDR development kit. This allows the FPGA to load its bit file from the SPI flash. The FPGA bit file contains the configuration of the FPGA including initial contents of the Microblaze local BRAM.  Next connect the Nexys4 DDR board via the JTAG usb connector. Start a serial terminal (eg. gtkterm) and select the port (eg. /dev/ttyUSB1) and set the baud rate to 38400 (as configured in the UARTlite block design).</p>\\n<p>Run the program FPGA command from the Xilinx menu. Select the bootloader.elf file (in the Bootloader/Debug project) in stead of \\\"bootloop\\\". Selecting \\\"program\\\" will generate a download.bit file in the \\\"mb_design_wrapper_hw_platform_0\\\" project. </p>\\n<p>After the programming completes, in the serial terminal you should see the bootloader starting (and failing).</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/072_Bootloader_Program_FPGA-77fd52366a94b46d70d1475c5889bb84-146ca.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 960px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 58.333333333333336%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Program FPGA\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Program FPGA\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/072_Bootloader_Program_FPGA-77fd52366a94b46d70d1475c5889bb84-146ca.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/072_Bootloader_Program_FPGA-77fd52366a94b46d70d1475c5889bb84-da9ed.png 300w,\\n/static/072_Bootloader_Program_FPGA-77fd52366a94b46d70d1475c5889bb84-d8c21.png 600w,\\n/static/072_Bootloader_Program_FPGA-77fd52366a94b46d70d1475c5889bb84-146ca.png 960w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"814-flashing-the-fpga-bitstream\\\"><a href=\\\"#814-flashing-the-fpga-bitstream\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>8.1.4.

Storing the bit file in the Flash chip is a more permanent solution that allows the FPGA to load the design every time the Nexys4 board is reset. Click the \\\"Program Flash\\\" menu item in the Xilinx menu. Select the download.bit files as \\\"image file\\\". The offset should be 0. The flash type is \\\"s25fl128sxxxxx0-spi-x1_x2_x4\\\".

Conclusion</h1>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Getting this the basic Microblaze architecture running requires many configuration steps. While writing this tutorial I had one working reference project and I created a new project to describe each step. The first time I ended up with a bootloader that did not fit in the BRAM. Somehow, somewhere the Microblaze cache size was set to 16 kB, instead of the required 32 kB. I suspect the block automation step to be the culprit. Luckily by checking the linker script in the SDK this was easy to find and correct.</li>\\n<li>When working in Linux check your Locale settings as described in the tutorial. If set wrongly the MIG7 wizard will not snow essential settings.</li>\\n<li>The Eclipse SDK crashed a few times resulting in a locked SDK which could not be restarted. Remove .lock files from the .metadata in src/sdk/workspace to get it working again. </li>\\n<li>Although lwIP is compiling I haven't had the time to do actual internet tests. The peripheral test example application however indicates the the ethernet phy is working.</li>\\n<li>Performance of the Microblaze has not been checked in this tutorial.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The VHDL code can be found in the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dwjbosman/basic_microblaze_nexys4_ddr\\\">Basic_microblaze</a> repository.</p>\\n<p>The next step will be to implement an AXI device that presents a memory mapped interface to the audio synthesis engine. Using the lwIP stack and some C code will then allow us to send commands to the synthesis engine via UDP.</p>\",\"timeToRead\":41,\"excerpt\":\"The goal is to develop an additive synthesis engine.

It explained how a two layer perceptron network could learn the XOR function. Back then I tried implementing the formulas and was able to do the feed-forward calculations. The training algorithm however still eluded me. Being able to perform forward calculations was already very exciting. I created a windows 95 screen save which would fill the screen with the output of a randomized neural network. The output images we're very interesting. Especially when replacing the activation functions of the network by exotic ones such as sin(x), abs(x) etc. (Although I lost the source code, you can still download it <a href=\\\"http://www.free-downloads-center.com/download/neural-screen-saver-v1-0-11252.html\\\">here</a>)</p>\\n<p>At the time it seemed that Neural networks were just another statistical method to interpolate data. Furthermore limited training data and the problem of vanishing gradients limited their usefulness. Fast forward to 2017. Massive amounts of training data and computing power are available. A number of relatively small improvements in the basic neural network algorithms have made it possible to train networks consisting of many more layers. These so-called deep neural networks have fueled progress and interest in Artificial Intelligence development.</p>\\n<p>One particular innovation that caught my attention is the LSTM neural network architecture. This architecture solves the issue of vanishing gradients for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). LSTM networks are especially suited to perform analysis of sequences and time series.

It's a toy example. Due to the periodic nature of the sine wave the train, dev, and test set overlap. This limits the possibilities to check if the network can generailize.  </p>\\n<p>This notebook can be <a href=\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwjbosman/tensorflow-experiments/master/Sine_LSTM_batch_size.ipynb\\\">downloaded</a> from my git repository.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-python\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> plotly\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">from</span> plotly<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>graph_objs <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> Scatter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> Layout\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> numpy <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">as</span> np\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> tensorflow <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">as</span> tf\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> sys\\nplotly<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>offline<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>init_notebook_mode<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>connected<span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span><span class=\\\"token boolean\\\">True</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">import</span> IPython<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">.</span>display\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h2 id=\\\"training-data\\\"><a href=\\\"#training-data\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Training data</h2>\\n<p>The following cell generates the training data.

Although inconvenient to work with this seems to be the future default. I will introduce some functions which help to work more easily with these state tuples. </p>\\n<p>In order to use the LSTM network to generate a predicted sequence of arbitrary length you need to store the state of the network. The output state after predicting a sample should be fed back in to the network when predicting the next sample.</p>\\n<p>The LSTM implementation in Tensor flow uses a LSTMStateTuple(c,h) data structure. The idea is to pack this LSTMStateTuple(c,h) into a 2D vector of size (batch_size, states). </p>\\n<p>There were some challenges implementing these packing/unpacking functions. Especially you want to avoid them beeing dependent on a specific batch<em>size. During building of the computation graph the batch</em>size should be None.</p>\\n<p>There is a pointer on how to use dynamic batch_sizes and packing/unpacking states <a href=\\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40438107/tensorflow-changing-batch-size-for-rnn-during-text-generation\\\">here</a>.

test the network. The training consists of 'epochs' during which all training batches are presented. After presenting a single training batch the network is immediately optimized. After an epoch the loss is calculated over the dev set and printed. </p>\\n<p>Next a graph is plotted which shows an example of the network predicting a sine wave. The prediction is based on first 'priming' the network by presenting part of a sine. </p>\\n<p>After completing training on a number of epochs. The last predictions is executed over a longer time period.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-python\\\"><code>np<span class=\\\"token

around with the parameters I found out that often the network performed better on the dev set than the train set! Clearly overlapping dev and train sets are nonsensical. Also the network seems to optimize on predicting the amplitude but not frequency. Probably the frequency can be better predicted by training on more then only one value (last_output).</p>\\n<p>This example gave me a good overview of some TensorFlow features. More generally there are so many hyper parameters to choose when building a network architecture:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>basic parameters: network size, learning rate, drop-out, optimization method</li>\\n<li>how to choose initial state</li>\\n<li>predict one sample, or multiple samples</li>\\n<li>loss function</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>It would be interesting to automatically tune the hyper-parameters as well. Maybe using genetic networks?</p>\\n<p>I am planning to use the approach in this article to process sampled sound waves. Things that cross my mind:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Apply on raw audio</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Sample microphone via WebAudo, send the samples to the notebook via WebSocket, analyze and feed the result back</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>Implement a phase vocodor, instead of raw audio, input the frequency features</li>\\n<li>Achieve something like <a href=\\\"https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/\\\">this</a></li>\\n<li>Process a MIDI file</li>\\n<li>Generate text</li>\\n<li>Train on multi-feature sequence (eg. audio and corresponding text)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Stay tuned....</p>\",\"timeToRead\":22,\"excerpt\":\"In 1996, during my last year in High School, I borrowed a book of a friend about neural networks.

Targeting the development of a music synthesizer, several building blocks have been explored: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hardware platform: Zynq 7020, Zedboard</li>\\n<li>Linux running on PS (dual core): systems management (MIDI, firmware management, embedded website)</li>\\n<li>I2S transmitter (implemented in logic), audio out</li>\\n<li>Sine wave oscillator</li>\\n<li>Possible use of a Microblaze softcore processor as co-processor.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The synthesis engine will be implemented in logic (PL). The synthesis engine employs the additive synthesis method. It will support 32 voices, each voice will consist of 1024 oscillators. Each oscillator consists of a simple sine wave with frequency, amplitude and pan parameters. Furthermore there will be a noise generator for each oscillator that can add band limited noise. In total this means that 32768 oscillators have to be realized. These oscillators need to output 24 bit stereo samples at 44 kHz. </p>\\n<p>Input to the audio engine are the slowly varying frequency, amplitude, pan and noise parameters. Some sort of \\\"envelope generator\\\" is needed for this purpose. The idea is to have the oscillator tracks i ready to be used in main memory. Each track consists of frequency, amplitude, pan and noise parameters stored at 20 Hz time resolution. This data needs to be streamed to the audio engine which will then use this data to update the oscillators and provide the audio samples. The envelope generator needs to be able to respond in 5 ms to an event (eg. stop or start of a voice). Any more delay will be noticeable when using the synthesizer in a live performance. </p>\\n<p>It would be great if the envelope generator could be developed using a traditional programming language instead of resorting to a pure logic approach. A standard programming language would offer more ease while development and possibly greater flexibility. However an important drawback could be the performance of the software as the software needs to provide data at 20 Hz for 32768 oscillators. In this article and the following article I will focus on the feasibility to use a Microblaze softcore as a envelope generator. This article focuses on the basic architecture. In the next article I will be investigating the performance.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"concept\\\"><a href=\\\"#concept\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Concept</h1>\\n<p>This article describes the following work:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Addition of a Microblaze softcore to the Zynq 7020 FPGA.</li>\\n<li>Program the Microblaze from Linux running on the PS.</li>\\n<li>Running bare metal firmware on the Microblaze.</li>\\n<li>Providing shared DDR memory between Linux and the Microblaze (Asymmetric Multi Processing).</li>\\n<li>Using Yocto to configure the Linux platform.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Simplified the design consists of the following components:</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/schematic-14adae51be8797778242851946564e53-cefc6.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 793px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 96.09079445145018%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"AMP schematic\\\"\\n        title=\\\"Asymmetric Multi Processing (AMP) setup\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/schematic-14adae51be8797778242851946564e53-cefc6.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/schematic-14adae51be8797778242851946564e53-3e77c.png 300w,\\n/static/schematic-14adae51be8797778242851946564e53-d20dc.png 600w,\\n/static/schematic-14adae51be8797778242851946564e53-cefc6.png 793w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"block-design\\\"><a href=\\\"#block-design\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Block Design</h1>\\n<h2 id=\\\"microblaze\\\"><a href=\\\"#microblaze\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Microblaze</h2>\\n<p>The Microblaze is configured to run code out of local BRAM memory. Furthermore it has a data cache to speed up accesses to DDR memory. The cache is connected via the HP0 port of the Zynq. This allows the Microblaze to access the DDR memory of the Zed board. This memory is shared with the Linux platform. </p>\\n<p>The Microblaze reset signal is connected to an AXI GPIO peripheral. This allows the Microblaze to be reset from Linux. The Xilinx SDK can generate some example applications. These applications require an uart is required. The Microblaze is configured with an AXI uartlite. This uart is connected to uart0 of the PS. This allows the serial output to be read from Linux without using any external cabling.</p>\\n<p>We want to use Linux to setup the firmware of the Microblaze. Thus Linux needs to have access to the BRAM. Unfortunately BRAM is only dual port, and both ports are in use by the Microblaze. A mux has been implemented which allows Linux to take control of the BRAM while the Microblaze is in reset. This will make it possible to program the Microblaze from within Linux.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"ps\\\"><a href=\\\"#ps\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>PS</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>The following PS peripherals are required in this project:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PS Uart0 (auxiliary serial communication between Microblaze and Linux)</li>\\n<li>PS Uart1 (Linux console command line terminal)</li>\\n<li>DDR Ram</li>\\n<li>SD card (boot and root partition Linux)</li>\\n<li>M_AXI_GP0 (Access AXI peripherals) </li>\\n<li>S_AXI_HP0 (Microblaze access DDR RAM)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 id=\\\"axi-interconnect\\\"><a href=\\\"#axi-interconnect\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>AXI Interconnect</h2>\\n<p>The interconnect has two slave interfaces.

A control signal selects which BRAM controller is connected to the BRAM. In Vivado the IP packager was used to wrap a small VHDL module. In the IP packager the individual in and outputs of the VHDL entity can be grouped into bus interfaces. BRAM uses \\\"BRAM_CTRL\\\" interfaces. Some remarks:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>In a first try I packaged a block design with an embedded/referenced RTL module as an IP. Although this seems to be supported since Vivado 2018.1 I was not able to get this to work. When using the IP I always got an error during implementation of the design that the referenced RTL module could not be found while using the IP (Black box instantiation error).</li>\\n<li>Although the types of the input and output interfaces were set to BRAM_CTRL during packaging,  the type was showed as 'OTHER' while using the IP. This was solved by manually updating the block design in which the IP is used.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/bram_interface-13b114dea36fcf16a708a711f48fd751-a7362.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative;

This model employs a Transformer network to predict the next word based on a given text. The examples on their website show that the network is able to generate high quality stories. Especially interesting is that the network is able to generate consistent stories. If the network generates a paragraph about a specific subject, then later on it can refer back to it. Unfortunately OpenAI decided not to make their most powerful model (1.5B trained parameters) publicly available as they fear that the model could be used for example to generate fake news or fake reviews (good marketing trick!). OpenAI did however make their less sophisticated (117M trained parameter and recently 345M trianed parameter) versions available.</p>\\n<p>I thought it would be interesting to see if GPT-2 can be used to implement a chat bot.

For example I attended an AI workshop in which a specific version of Tensor Flow and Python were required. At least an hour was wasted getting the software running on everyone's computer. Welcome to \\\"configuration management\\\"!</p>\\n<p>I have been using Docker to solve some of the problems. Docker can be compared to a virtual machine but is more lightweight. All required software versions and special tweaks are installed inside the Docker image. You can instantiate the image as an isolated container. Removing a container or restoring to a clean state is easy. Docker has been around for years and many open source projects benefit by providing a ready to use Docker Image. So users wanting to evaluate can get started within minutes.</p>\\n<center>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/media-guide\\\"><img src=\\\"/rust-logo-blk-b653c6e07999f2b00977c97e126edf79.svg\\\"/></a>\\n</center>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\nAs a practical use case I wanted to play with the programming language Rust, and especially Rust for embedded systems. Rust is interesting because it can produce high performance efficient software, it has constructs for 'safe' memory management and could be a competitor to C. Getting Rust running is not that hard. Getting Rust running with bare metal ARM support for embedded development is a little bit more work. What about an IDE? \\n<p>Certainly when starting out with a new programming language you want to have modern editor support. I expect from an editor to support:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>syntax high lighting</li>\\n<li>code completion</li>\\n<li>definition lookup</li>\\n<li>debugging using breakpoints. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In most cases I have been using Vim with some plugins. I have always had a love-hate relationship with Vim. In general I spend too much time configuring it and looking up keyboard commands. Its killer feature for me is that I'm able to work through a remote terminal without installing any tooling locally. Now and then I have been looking for editors that could replace it. Essential for a replacement is that it would have a great editor as a front end running locally but would also have a back end supporting specific tools/programming languages running remotely. </p>\\n<p>Some editors have support for remote editing (for example via sshfs) but they still require all dependent libraries to be installed locally in order to do semantic checking or code completion. A few exciting open source applications have started to address this. Especially Eclipse Che and Theia caught my attention. Theia is a VS Code clone that runs in the browser. Therefore its back end naturally runs remotely. It uses the <a href=\\\"https://langserver.org/\\\">Remote Language Server (LSP)</a> API designed by Microsoft. The editor front end can support multiple programming languages as long as an LSP implementation is available. Even more Theia can also run VS Code plugins. </p>\\n<br>\\n<center>\\n<a href=\\\"https://www.theia-ide.org/docs/\\\">\\n<img src=\\\"/theia-logo-afa131925898e946f870c011f1e8c215.svg\\\" width=\\\"300px\\\"/></a>\\n</center>\\n<br>\\n<br>\\n<p>By installing Theia and its back end in a Docker image the ideal situation is realized. By providing a Docker Image one can easily run the whole back end in an isolated container. This container could run in the cloud or locally. One of the more challenging tasks while designing the Docker image was to create a few scripts to instantiate the Docker image in such a way that you can actually access your files outside the isolated container. I'm currently busy finalizing the embedded docker Theia image. You can find it <a href=\\\"https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-apps/tree/theia-rust-embedded-docker\\\">here</a>. There is a README which contains further instructions.</p>\\n<p>This Docker image is not yet available in the main branch of theia-apps, but you can try it from the theia-rust-embedded-docker branch until I finish it. It already can compile Rust programs for ARM, run them in Qemu and even debug them using GDB. A Rust IDE for non embedded development is already available in master. Have a look at the other apps as well. On my wish list is is still an ADA IDE based on Theia. </p>\\n<p>Note: For those using VS Code, recently an interesting <a href=\\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers\\\">extension</a> was released which allows VS Code to manage a Docker container running the LSP server! </p>\",\"timeToRead\":3,\"excerpt\":\"I love trying new software...
