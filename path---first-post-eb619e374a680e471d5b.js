Jekkyl is another static site generation tool. It\'s main advantage is that Github Pages natively supports this tool. So there\'s no need to push the output of the static site build tool to a repo. You can just update the blog source repo and Github will update your site. Unfortunately Github will only allow a very limited set of Jekkyl plugins.</p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"First blog post I just installed Pelican for my professional blog.
